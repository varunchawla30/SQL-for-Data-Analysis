#whenever business started operations

#month, we see when the next visit is.

select  *, lead(month) over (partition by cust_id order by month) as Next_month_Visit

# 3: Calculate the time gaps between visits

create view  time_gap_vw as select *, Next_month_Visit - month as Time_gap from time_lapse_vw;

# 4: categorise the customer with time gap 1 as retained, >1 as irregular and
#NULL as churned
